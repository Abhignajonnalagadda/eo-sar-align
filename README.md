# EO/SAR Split-View Map with AOI Clip & Align

A full-stack web application for processing and aligning Earth Observation (EO) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery. Users can upload two GeoTIFF images, draw an Area of Interest (AOI), and process them to create clipped and aligned versions for comparison using an interactive split-view map.

## Features

### Interactive Map Interface
- **Split-View Visualization**: Side-by-side comparison of two GeoTIFF images using Leaflet with `leaflet-side-by-side` plugin
- **Interactive AOI Drawing**: Draw Area of Interest rectangles by holding Cmd/Ctrl and dragging on the map
- **Real-time Map Updates**: Live visualization of both original and processed images
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS

### Image Processing Pipeline
- **Automatic Clipping**: Clips both images to the specified AOI bounds using rasterio
- **Image Alignment**: Aligns Image B to Image A using phase cross-correlation from scikit-image
- **Coordinate System Handling**: Properly handles WGS84 to image CRS transformations
- **Fallback Processing**: Gracefully handles alignment failures

### Job Management
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Background job processing with real-time status updates
- **Job Status Tracking**: Visual status indicators (Idle, Pending, Running, Done, Error)
- **Output Toggle**: Switch between original and processed images seamlessly
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and validation

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend (React + Vite)
- **Framework**: React 19 with Vite for fast development and building
- **Mapping**: Leaflet with `leaflet-side-by-side` for split-view functionality
- **GeoTIFF Handling**: `georaster` and `georaster-layer-for-leaflet` for raster visualization
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for API communication

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
- **API Server**: Express.js with CORS support
- **File Handling**: Multer for multipart file uploads
- **Job Management**: JSON-based job queue with UUID tracking
- **File Storage**: Organized upload and output directories

### Worker (Python)
- **Image Processing**: Rasterio for GeoTIFF manipulation
- **Alignment Algorithm**: Phase cross-correlation from scikit-image
- **Coordinate Systems**: GDAL for CRS transformations
- **Dependencies**: NumPy for numerical operations

### Containerization

## üß† Image Processing Pipeline

### 1. Image Clipping
- **Input**: Original GeoTIFF files and AOI bounds in WGS84
- **Process**: 
  - Transform AOI bounds from WGS84 to image coordinate system
  - Use `rasterio.mask` for precise geometric clipping
  - Maintain original data types and metadata
- **Output**: Clipped images saved as `A_clipped.tif` and `B_clipped.tif`

### 2. Image Alignment
- **Method**: Phase cross-correlation from scikit-image
- **Process**:
  1. Normalize both images to zero mean and unit variance
  2. Compute phase cross-correlation with upsampling for sub-pixel accuracy
  3. Apply detected translation using affine transformation
  4. Fall back to original clipped image if alignment fails
- **Output**: Aligned image saved as `B_clipped_aligned.tif`

### Alignment Algorithm Details

**Phase Cross-Correlation** is used because it:
- Is robust to illumination changes between images
- Works well with different image types (EO vs SAR)
- Provides sub-pixel accuracy
- Handles translation effectively

**Limitations**:
- Only handles translation, not rotation or scaling
- Works best with similar image resolutions
- May struggle with very different image types

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Local Development (without Docker)

1. **Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd api
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. **Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd web
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Worker** (requires Python 3.8+ and GDAL):
   ```bash
   cd worker
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python worker.py --help
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### Technical Limitations
- **Alignment Method**: Only handles translation, not rotation or scaling
- **File Size**: Large GeoTIFFs (>150MB) may cause browser performance issues
- **Coordinate Systems**: Assumes AOI is in WGS84 (EPSG:4326)
- **Image Types**: Works best with similar image types and resolutions
- **Browser Compatibility**: Requires modern browsers with WebGL support

### Performance Considerations
- **Processing Time**: Real image processing takes longer than mock operations
- **Memory Usage**: Large images require significant memory for processing
- **Browser Rendering**: Complex GeoTIFFs may need downsampling for smooth display
- **Network**: Large file uploads may timeout on slow connections

## üîÆ Future Improvements

### Enhanced Alignment
- Support for rotation and scaling in alignment
- Feature-based alignment (SIFT/ORB) for better accuracy
- Multi-scale alignment for different resolutions

### User Experience
- Progressive image loading and tiling
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Undo/redo functionality for AOI drawing

### Technical Enhancements
- Support for different coordinate systems
- Batch processing capabilities
- Cloud storage integration
- Real-time collaboration features

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Images not loading**:
   - Check file format (must be .tif/.tiff)
   - Verify georeferencing is present
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Processing fails**:
   - Verify AOI bounds are within image extent
   - Check file permissions in data directory
   - Review worker logs for detailed error messages

3. **Alignment poor**:
   - Images may be too different in type or resolution
   - Try with smaller AOI areas
   - Check if images have sufficient overlap


### Debugging

**View logs**:
```bash
# All services
docker compose logs

# Specific service
docker compose logs web
docker compose logs api
docker compose logs worker
```

**Check data directory**:
```bash
# Verify uploaded files
ls -la data/uploads/

# Check processed outputs
ls -la data/outputs/
```
